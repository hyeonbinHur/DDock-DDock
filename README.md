## **About The Project**

The idea for this project originated from my experience in Melbourne. Living there as a student, I was able to meet a lot of international students and foreigners. They typically live in rental houses or share houses, necessitating frequent relocations. Additionally, Australia ranks among the top five most expensive countries globally, attracting many people to work from abroad. Most of these individuals seek various experiences, so they move often. Each move requires them to buy new furniture, which poses a significant financial burden for those trying to save money. I noticed that due to high living costs and frequent moves, many people often discard a lot of items and buy new ones. As a result, many people either avoid buying new items or inquire among acquaintances for used goods. Moreover, in such environments where many young people gather, I frequently encountered the need for communities to make friends. However, Australia still lacks representative communities that provide meeting opportunities for both foreigners and locals. Based on these observations, I found the potential of used goods and forming communities.

## Features

### Items

1. add Item

To create an item, the user needs to be authenticated and access the add item page. When the user accesses the item page, they can add detailed information about the item, including images, title, description, price, etc. When the user creates an item, the images of the item are first stored in Firebase storage. Then, a function returns the URL for the images, and both the detailed information and image URL are stored in the Firestore database.

> Once the user fills out the form and presses **Save**, they will see a confirmation modal to confirm the item. If the user presses **Edit**, they can return to the add item page. Once the user presses **Confirm**, they will see a spinner until the item is added. When the item is successfully added, the page will move to the corresponding item section and lead the user to view the added item.

If user press a certain item in the item list, user can check the detailed information of the item. The url link includes the item's id, and the program leads user to the deatiled information about the item.

> **useParams()**, and **dynamic path** are used to read a certain data. Moreover, to render the item detail page, <Link> and **static path** are used.

Once the user accesses the item detail page, user will be able see the author's information. When another user's avatar is pressed, a popup division appears, which includes a profile and a chatting button to either move to the user's profile page or start a chat.

3. edit Item

> To edit an item, the item URL must be changed. Editing the item page requires multiple steps. There are several ways to edit the image URL; I chose to delete the old image and add a new one to prevent the storage from becoming too large. Firstly, check whether the images are already stored; if an image is not stored in the storage, it will be uploaded. Moreover, if the images in the storage are no longer used, they will be deleted. Once all progress regarding the storage is complete, a function returns all image URLs in storage, changes the image URL, and updates it. Titles, descriptions, and prices can also be edited.

4. delete Item

Only the item's author is able to see the delete button in the item detail page. Once the author presses the delete button user can delete the item.

> Once user press the delete button, the item's images in the storage will be deleted first, and if all images of the item are deleted, the item will be deleted from the firestore as well.

5. like item

Once signed in, the user can press the like button on the corresponding item. If the user presses the "heart" icon, the "empty heart" will change to a "red heart"; otherwise, it reverts to an "empty heart." If the user likes the item, it will be added to their list of liked items, which can be checked from the user's profile page.

##### While planning the project, I wanted to cover all municipalities and suburbs, but it was challenging for me to find the same Melbourne location JSON data and the "nominatim.openstreetmap" API address. Users can change the location, but only suburbs in Melbourne city can be filtered.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Reflecting on the Project

When I started the project, I aimed to deploy this web service and wanted people in Melbourne to use this application in their real lives. However, while creating the application, I became aware of my shortcomings, such as filtering locations and reducing HTTP requests. Throughout the implementation, I learned a great deal and was able to troubleshoot many problems. I faced countless errors and spent a lot of time figuring them out, which enhanced my troubleshooting skills. My goal for this application is to deploy it within a year. I need to learn more about React and database management. I plan to switch the database from Firebase to AWS to reduce costs and improve network service quality.
